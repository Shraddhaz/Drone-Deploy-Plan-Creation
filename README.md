# Drone-Deploy-Plan-Creation

### Coding Task Given

Many DroneDeploy users have shape files that represent location boundaries such as the perimeter of their farm.
 
Your job is to build an app on the DroneDeploy App Market to allow customers to import these .shp/.kml/.zip files as drone flight plans.
  
If you desire you can use this javascript library to translate a shp file to json.

Here are the docs for building an app on the app market.
